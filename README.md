# Start2impact Python exercise: Trading bot
Exercise to practice with the Coinmarketcap APIs: the Trading bot checks every 10 minutes if more than 4 currencies have increased in price by more than 3% in the last hour. If so, it open a buy order for the currency that has increased the most. If the purchased currency drops more than 1% in the last hour, the bot close the order by selling the currency. Only one order can be opened at a time.
